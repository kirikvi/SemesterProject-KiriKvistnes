        <p>Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on down to our museum, there’s plenty to see and do.</p>
        <p>You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth?</p> 
        <p>Our exhibits are designed to be accessible for interested minds, so make sure you come ready to learn and explore.</p>
        <p>We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you’ll get to explore and experiment with our team of experts.</p>
        <p>During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you can join other children your age to go on a journey of discovery.</p> 
        <p>Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more about the holiday club and how you can join, send us a message.</p>
